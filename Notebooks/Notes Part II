What I am doing in the code:

Incoherences
  1. customer_region - transformed  '-' into Unknown
  2. last_promo - transformed '-' into the string 'NONE' (I can change this into NO PROMOTION if we want)
  3. Deleted all the customers that have 0 as value in the columns of DOW_, HR_ and CUI_, since they are non customers
Things I might still do: Remove lost customers or not active customers, like the ones that only did 1 purchase

Feature Engeneering
  1. Joined columns DOW_1 to DOW_5 into a single feature called Orders_Weekday
  2. Joined columns DOW_0 and DOW_6 into a single feature called Orders_Weekend
  3. Joined columns CUI_Chinese, CUI_Noodle Dishes and CUI_Chiken Dishes into CUI_Chinese
  4. Created features CUI_SoutheastAsia that is the sum od CUI_Indian and CUI_Thai
  5. Created feature CUI_Western that aggregates columns CUI_American and CUI_Italian
  6. Created feature CUI_Street_Food_Beverages that aggregates columns CUI_Street Food / Snacks and CUI_Beverages
  7. Created feature Early Morning that aggregates columns HR_5 to HR_8
  8. Created feature Morning that aggregates columns HR_9 to HR_11
  9. Created feature Afternoon that aggregates columns HR_12 to HR_16
  10. Created feature Evening that aggregates columns HR_17 to HR_20
  11. Created feature Night that aggregates columns HR_21 to HR_4
  12. Created dummies of the column last_promo (this created features last_promo_DISCOUNT, last_promo_FREEBIE, last_promo_NONE) so 0, 0, 0 means DELIVERY
  13. Created dummies of the column payment_method (this created features payment_method_CASH, and payment_method_DIGI) so 0, 0, 0 means CREDIT CARD
  14. Created a new feature Chain_Frequency_Category that uses is chain and classifies them based on the frequency customers go there
  15. Used Ordinal Encoding to turn those categories into numbers
  16. Agregated the values "2440", "4140", "8370", "2490", "8550" into a single category "Other"
  17. Created dummies for the customer_region (this created features customer_region_4660, customer_region_8670, customer_region_Other) so 0, 0, 0 means region 2360

Handling Missing Values 
  1. Dropped unecessary columns ()
  2. 
  3. 
  4.

# Customer Segmentation Machine Learning Project

This repository contains all the resources for our **Customer Segmentation** project of ficticious company ABCDEats Inc. The project aims to analyse customer data, perform clustering segmentation, and build an interactive platform to visualize and explore the results. The repository includes datasets, notebooks, reports, and visualizations produced during the project.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation using Data Mining techniques. The project is divided into several stages, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, and building an interactive platform to explore the results. Different clustering algorithms were applied (K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering), and the results are visualized using two different techniques (UMAP and t-SNE) to offer deeper insights into customer behaviour.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several folders that contain key resources, deliverables, and insights:

### 🗂️ **Datasets**
This folder contains the data used for the project:

- **Customer Data**: A dataset with customer information used for clustering analysis.
- **Cluster Labels**: A dataset with the labels assigned to the clusters, used as input for the interactive platform to explore cluster memberships.

### 📑 **Description**
This folder contains essential a document related to the description of the project:

- **Project Description PDF**: A detailed PDF describing the project's objectives, methodology, and goals.

### 📊 **Figures**
This folder contains visualizations produced during the project:

- **Clustering**: Contains images and plots relevant to the clustering segmentation process, showcasing different clustering results and insights.
- **EDA**: Stores images and plots related to the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, including visualizations of the data distributions and relationships between features.

### 📚 **Notebooks**
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for each part of the project:

- **Part I**: The notebook for the first phase of the project, which includes data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.
- **Part II**: The notebook for the second phase, which focuses on applying clustering algorithms and evaluating the results.
- **Bonus Part**: The notebook for the bonus part of the project, which involves building the interactive platform and integrating the clustering results.

### 📄 **Reports**
This folder contains the final reports for each part of the project:

- **Part I Report**: The report summarizing the first phase of the project, including EDA and preprocessing steps.
- **Part II Report**: The report detailing the clustering methods, results, and analysis from the second part of the project.
- **Bonus Project Report**: The final report covering the interactive platform, its features, and the overall project conclusions.
